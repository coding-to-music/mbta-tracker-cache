## Environment variables:

In the project root, create a file named `secrets.py` and populate it with your MBTA v3 API key: `API_KEY = <KEY>`

```java
API_KEY = <KEY>
```

## GitHub

```java
git init
git add .
git remote remove origin
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:coding-to-music/mbta-tracker-cache.git
git push -u origin main
```

# tracker-cache
tracker-cache is the backend for [https://newtrains.today](https://newtrains.today). The browser display components are located [here](https://github.com/mathcolo/tracker-static).

## Installation requirements
- Python 3.6+ with [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed
- Redis


## Development instructions
1. In the project root, create a file named `secrets.py` and populate it with your MBTA v3 API key: `API_KEY = <KEY>`
2. Install and run both [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) locally
3. In the root directory, run `pipenv install` to install Python dependencies
4. Run `python pull.py` to populate your Redis cache a single time (in production this is run every minute via cron)
5. Run `python server.py` to begin serving the API locally
6. Set up [tracker-static](https://github.com/mathcolo/tracker-static) to see the API consumed by the front-end JavaScript.

# install virtualenv

Using virtualenv, you can create isolated Python environments for each project or application, which can be used to install and manage different versions of Python and packages.

Here are the steps to install Python 3.6 alongside Python 3.8 using virtualenv:

Install virtualenv by running the following command:

```java
sudo apt-get install virtualenv
```

Create a new virtual environment for Python 3.6 by running the following command:

```java
virtualenv -p python3.6 pyenv36
```

This will create a new virtual environment named myenv36 with Python 3.6 as the default Python version.

Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

```java
source pyenv36/bin/activate
```

This will activate the virtual environment and set the default Python version to Python 3.6.

Install any packages or dependencies you need for your project using pip, just like you would in a regular Python environment.

To switch back to the system-wide Python installation or another virtual environment, you can deactivate the current virtual environment by running the following command:

```java
deactivate
```

This will deactivate the current virtual environment and return you to the system-wide Python installation.

You can repeat these steps to create additional virtual environments for different versions of Python, and switch between them as needed for different projects or applications.

## Here are the steps to install Python 3.6 alongside Python 3.8 using pyenv:

Install pyenv by following the instructions in the official pyenv GitHub repository: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation

You'll need to choose the installation method appropriate for your system. For Ubuntu, you can use the curl method as follows:

```java
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Install Python 3.6 using pyenv by running the following command:

```java
pyenv install 3.6.15

pyenv install 3.8
```

This will download and install Python 3.6.0 into your pyenv installation.

Create a new virtual environment for Python 3.6 by running the following command:

```java
pyenv virtualenv 3.6.15 py3.6

pyenv virtualenv 3.8 py3.8
```

This will create a new virtual environment named myenv36 with Python 3.6.0 as the default Python version.

Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

```java
pyenv activate py3.6

pyenv activate py3.8
```

This will activate the virtual environment and set the default Python version to Python 3.6.0.

Install any packages or dependencies you need for your project using pip, just like you would in a regular Python environment.

To switch back to the system-wide Python installation or another virtual environment, you can deactivate the current virtual environment by running the following command:

```java
pyenv deactivate
```

This will deactivate the current virtual environment and return you to the system-wide Python installation.

## Add this to .bash_aliases or .bashrc

```java
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```


## List installed pyenv environments

```java
pyenv versions
```

```java
  system
  3.6.15
  3.6.15/envs/py3.6
* py3.6 --> /home/tmc/.pyenv/versions/3.6.15/envs/py3.6 (set by PYENV_VERSION environment variable)
```
