## Development instructions
1. In the project root, create a file named `secrets.py` and populate it with your MBTA v3 API key: `API_KEY = <KEY>`
2. Install and run both [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) locally
3. In the root directory, run `pipenv install` to install Python dependencies
4. Run `python pull.py` to populate your Redis cache a single time (in production this is run every minute via cron)

6. Set up [tracker-static](https://github.com/mathcolo/tracker-static) to see the API consumed by the front-end JavaScript.
